# Vercel migration — Prompt 370

Status: implementation in progress. Preview Blob (server SDK) and Neon
database/RLS seams are proven; no deployment, preview or production, exists.
Starting source: `a1350d0` on `main`.
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-vercel-managed-production.md) records the accepted target.

## Resume here (new session)

Prompt 370 is approved and still executing; do not write a new prompt for its
remaining scope. A new session resumes it from this section and `git log`.

**Fixed target.** Team `dgsloxx417's projects`
(`team_zE3mp7nrEZ6a7cxRavwUMYC4`), project `acres`
(`prj_q9ApajZWDgdYZetnm5s5oakEjrUD`), region `iad1` / `aws-us-east-1`,
**free tiers only** (stop and report if a gate needs paid usage), Resend
deferred until the user owns a sender domain. The repository is linked
(`.vercel/`, gitignored). Never use the two unrelated Neon projects in the
Vercel-managed org or the other thirteen Vercel projects.

**Re-establish access (no secrets in the repo or chat).**

1. Vercel MCP: authenticate if its tools are absent. CLI: `npx vercel@latest
whoami`; if signed out, the user runs `! npx vercel@latest login`.
2. Secrets directory `~/.config/acres/vercel-preview/` (0700, files 0600):
   `preview.env` (from `npx vercel@latest env pull <dir>/preview.env
--environment=preview --yes`), `neon-roles.env` (generated role
   passwords) and `neon-urls.env` (migrator direct URL, `acres_app` pooled
   and direct URLs). List names only (`cut -d= -f1`), never values. If lost,
   re-pull `preview.env` and rerun the bootstrap: it regenerates passwords
   and re-sets them on the roles.
3. Node 24 for checks: `.node-version` pins **24.21.0**; the system Node is 26. Without a version manager, `npm install --prefix /tmp/acres-node24
--no-save --ignore-scripts node-linux-x64@24.21.0` and put
   `/tmp/acres-node24/node_modules/node-linux-x64/bin` first on `PATH`
   (the npm shim must also resolve to that Node; check `node --version`
   inside `npm run`).

**Re-run the proofs (idempotent, preview only).**

```bash
scripts/vercel/neon-bootstrap.sh            # roles, database, PostGIS
(set -a; . ~/.config/acres/vercel-preview/neon-urls.env; set +a; \
  cd server && npx prisma migrate deploy)   # migrator, direct host
scripts/vercel/neon-verify.sh               # harden + RLS/pooling evidence
(set -a; . ~/.config/acres/vercel-preview/preview.env; set +a; \
  ACRES_VERCEL_PROBE=isolated-synthetic-preview \
  VERCEL_TEAM_ID=team_zE3mp7nrEZ6a7cxRavwUMYC4 \
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_q9ApajZWDgdYZetnm5s5oakEjrUD \
  node scripts/vercel/probe-platform.js blob)
```

**Remaining work, in order** (each ends verified, reviewed, recorded here and
committed per AGENTS.md §2):

- [ ] **Queues consumer** — wire `@vercel/queue` behind the existing queue
      port around `server/src/worker/job-processor.service.ts`: same-project
      producer/consumer, forged-callback denial, duplicate/retry/interruption
      idempotency, preview isolation. Load the `vercel:queues`,
      `vercel:vercel-functions`, `nestjs-best-practices` skills first.
- [ ] **Blob browser upload** — scoped client tokens, direct upload above the
      function body limit, callback provenance, tenant authorization,
      cancel/delete, download revocation (`vercel:vercel-storage`).
- [ ] **Scanner image** — build and push a pinned VCR ClamAV image with
      checksum-bound `main.cvd`/`daily.cvd`, then run the scanner probe with
      `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `ACRES_VERCEL_PROBE_REGION=iad1`,
      `ACRES_SCANNER_IMAGE` (digest-pinned), `ACRES_SCANNER_MAIN_SHA256`,
      `ACRES_SCANNER_DAILY_SHA256` and `ACRES_SCANNER_MAX_SIGNATURE_AGE_HOURS`
      (see [the probe guide](../infra/vercel/README.md)) plus the live failure
      cases (`vercel:vercel-sandbox`). Hobby: 45-minute sessions, 5
      CPU-hours/month.
- [ ] **First preview deployment** — Services/route config, only the
      `acres_app` pooled URL as a **sensitive** `DATABASE_URL`, remove or mark
      sensitive the `NEON_OWNER_*` variables, migrations as a guarded
      non-runtime step, distributed throttling, protected endpoints
      (`vercel:vercel-services`, `vercel:deployments-cicd`, `vercel:env-vars`).
- [ ] **Production decision** — Cron proves only on production; Hobby is
      non-commercial. Needs the user's plan decision and the eleven launch
      categories before any promotion.

## Access and target

On 2026-10-15 plugin discovery returned Vercel `installed: false`, with an
existing suggestion. Neither `vercel` nor `firecrawl` was found on PATH.
Official web documentation is the approved research fallback. No credential
stores were searched. Selected team/project, region, plan/spend, sender domain,
operator test address and existing hosted data/deployments remain unverified.
A consolidated request is pending; generic migration/deployment approval already
exists. No resource creation, billable probe or mail delivery occurs on guesses.

### Account inspection and provisioning — 2026-10-15

Vercel MCP connected after user OAuth. Read-only inspection: one team,
`dgsloxx417's projects` (`team_zE3mp7nrEZ6a7cxRavwUMYC4`); thirteen unrelated
projects, none named Acres; Marketplace already holds a free Neon installation
whose Vercel-managed Neon org has two unrelated projects (left untouched).
User decisions: new project, **iad1 / aws-us-east-1**, **free tiers only**
(stop and report when a gate needs a paid plan), Resend deferred.

Official pricing pages read this session: Sandbox on Hobby is free within
5 active-CPU hours, 5,000 creations, 10 concurrent and 45-minute sessions per
month, pausing (not billing) past quota; Queues (Beta) is available on all
plans; Cron invokes production deployments only, so the Cron gate cannot be
proven on a preview. Hobby is a non-commercial plan — a launch-time plan
decision, not a proof blocker.

| Vercel project `acres`           | `prj_q9ApajZWDgdYZetnm5s5oakEjrUD` | no framework/Git yet, functions and Sandbox default `iad1`, Node 24.x, Vercel Authentication on all deployments except custom domains, no deployment |
| Blob store `acres-preview-probe` | `store_g2fmCH5CW7TJbkN3`           | private, `iad1`, linked to `acres`; its `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` was narrowed to preview/development only (never production)                          |

Neon creation through the Neon MCP was refused (`organization is managed by
Vercel`); Vercel MCP exposes no Marketplace resource-provisioning call, so the
Neon/PostGIS resource needs the dashboard or an authenticated Vercel CLI.
No secret was decrypted or printed through MCP.

### Hosted proofs — 2026-10-15

The user provisioned Neon in the dashboard (Free, US East, `acres` project,
Preview + Development only, no per-deployment branching, prefix
`NEON_OWNER`, not sensitive so the owner URL could be pulled once) and signed
the Vercel CLI in (64.1.0, via `npx`). `vercel link` targeted `acres`; the
created `.env.local` and a `vercel env pull --environment=preview` file were
moved to a 0700 session scratch directory outside the repository and only
variable names were listed.

**Blob (server SDK).** `npm run vercel:probe -- blob` on Node 24.21.0 against
`acres-preview-probe` returned `bytes 5242880, checksumVerified true,
anonymousReadDenied true, browserUploadProven false, cleanupSucceeded true,
launchApproved false`; a follow-up store read showed no residue. The store's
connection metadata still lists production, but the env var targets only
preview/development.

**Database.** Neon reports PostgreSQL **18.6** with PostGIS **3.6.4**
available, matching the reference `postgis/postgis:18-3.6`. `neondb_owner` is a
`neon_superuser` member with `BYPASSRLS`, so it is bootstrap-only. A session
script mirrored `bootstrap-production-roles.sh`: `acres_migrator` (LOGIN,
CREATEDB, BYPASSRLS), `acres_app` (LOGIN, NOBYPASSRLS, not in
`neon_superuser`), `acres_test` as a **NOLOGIN placeholder** only because
migrations grant to it, database `acres` owned by the migrator, PostGIS,
default privileges, and `PUBLIC` connect revoked on `neondb`/`acres`.
Generated passwords stayed in that scratch directory. `prisma migrate deploy`
as the migrator over the direct host applied all **18** migrations; status
reports the schema up to date. Hardening mirrored
`harden-runtime-privileges.sh` for the `acres` database.

Verification as `acres_app` over **both** the pooled and the direct host:
42 tables, **30 RLS-enabled and all 30 forced**; the 12 non-RLS tables are
exactly the reference database's set; no-context `Organization` read returns
0 rows; insert into `AuditEvent` without context fails with the RLS policy
error; `_prisma_migrations` read is permission-denied; PostGIS functions run;
a transaction-local organization context is empty after commit. Pooled
context reuse: 20 sequential sessions with 0 leaked contexts and 8 concurrent
transactions each reading back only their own context. This proves the
database role/RLS seam, not the application's pooled Prisma behaviour under
real traffic.

**Pooler constraint (found by review follow-up).** On the pooled host a
**session-level** `set_config(..., false)` survived into the next client in
10/10 attempts: Neon's pooler does not reset session state between clients.
Tenant context must therefore always be transaction-local. Every
`set_config` in `server/src` (excluding specs) passes `true` today; keep it
that way and never use `SET` without `LOCAL` for `acres.*` settings. The
verify script reports this as `info pooled_session_level_leaks`, then resets
the probe value and asserts no residue. `scripts/vercel/neon-verify.sh` now
exits nonzero on any failed assertion; both scripts pass passwords to psql via
the environment only.

Follow-ups before any deployment: put the `acres_app` pooled URL (and never an
owner/migrator URL) in project env as **sensitive**; remove or mark sensitive
the `NEON_OWNER_*` variables; move migration execution to a guarded,
non-runtime step; decide whether to retire the `acres_test` placeholder from
hosted migrations.

## Target and gates

Vercel Services is the candidate single-project arrangement, documented in Beta
with internal bindings and explicit public routing. Nest uses native Function
entrypoint detection. The account-specific arrangement and queue consumer layout
require a preview proof before active configuration is added.

| Gate              | Required evidence                                                                                                            | Current state                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database          | Migrated isolated Neon/PostGIS; runtime cannot bypass forced RLS; pooled context reuse, concurrent transactions and rollback | Proven for preview at the database seam (2026-10-15); application-level pooled Prisma acceptance open |
| Blob              | Private direct browser upload above function body limit; scoped token, authorized private read, checksum, cancel/delete      | Server SDK proof passed (2026-10-15); browser direct upload, scoped tokens and cancel still open      |
| Scanner           | Pinned Sandbox scanner/signatures; clean/EICAR, missing/stale signatures, timeout/memory/byte limits and cleanup             | Blocked: account/plan and pinned scanner source/signatures absent                                     |
| Durable execution | Same-project producer/consumer, forged request denial, duplicate/retry/interruption and preview isolation                    | Blocked: selected project/layout and live access absent                                               |
| Production        | Account-bound recovery, capacity, telemetry, security and eleven signed launch categories                                    | Open; no categories approved by local implementation                                                  |

## Implementation record

Local code/results are recorded here after verification. Neither reference
Compose checks nor mocked tests establish managed integration. Do not set a
managed profile live until all its ports and distributed security are wired and
verified. Retain the existing profile, schema and public contracts meanwhile.

## Local implementation — 2026-10-15

- Extracted `server/src/worker/job-processor.service.ts`. The current BullMQ
  worker delegates per-job work; startup, shutdown, dispatch and metrics stay in
  its transport. No claim of managed idempotency/leases or invocation-safe whole
  module; those are required follow-on work after proofs.
- Added optional `MAIL_TRANSPORT=resend`, typed key configuration, explicit
  sender requirement and a fixed-HTTPS native-fetch mail adapter. Native HTTP
  avoids the inspected SDK's development error logging; no Resend SDK remains
  installed. No real email was sent. SMTP/memory remain defaults.
- Progress now continues through REST polling after stream EOF/setup/read
  failure, honors cancellation and terminal state and reports read failure.
  Default two-second interval/fifteen-minute budget are implementation choices.
- Pinned Blob **2.8.2** and Sandbox **3.8.0** as development-only dependencies in the server workspace and added
  opt-in synthetic probes plus local failure tests. Neither SDK is selected by
  application boot. [Probe guide](../infra/vercel/README.md) records exact
  invocation, restricted environment inventory, cleanup and proof limitations.
- Added Node **24.x** engine declarations and `.node-version` **24.21.0**.
  Downloaded that exact verified binary under `/tmp` for checks without changing
  global tooling. Clean-install and hosted Node configuration remain unproven.

The user directed automation through Vercel MCP. A fresh discovery after that
instruction again returned `installed: false`; no Vercel callable tool was
available. The existing connection suggestion needs completing by the user.
No CLI deployment or arbitrary-account fallback was attempted. Broader provider
profile wiring, Blob upload protocol, queue/workflow/Cron callbacks, distributed
throttling, managed evidence schema/recovery, real-provider acceptance and
preview/production deployment remain unfinished behind account/proof gates.
No completion score, category approval or phase exit changes.

## Rollback and local inspection

Ordinary revert of this preparatory commit restores the prior code, lockfile,
Node declaration and documentation; no schema or hosted object was migrated.
Use Node 24 (`.node-version`), install the locked dependencies, then `npm run
build` and `npm run dev:server` / `npm run dev:client` with the existing local
environment. `/app/datasets` and `/app/reports` retain their existing layouts.
`npm run vercel:probe -- --help` is credential-free. Keep real probe secrets in
the restricted environment described in the guide; no examples contain values.

## Verification and independent review

Final runtime checks use an explicit temporary `node` **and** `npm` launcher
pair; `npm version --json` reported Node **24.21.0**, npm **12.0.2**. Initial
PATH-only runs used the machine's mise npm shim and actually ran Node 26.11.1;
those runs are excluded from Node 24 compatibility claims. No global tooling
or credential files were changed. The SDK exports also loaded directly on
Node 24 (`PASS: pinned Blob/Sandbox CommonJS exports load on Node 24`).

The sequential Node 24 checks passed contract drift, root lint, root typecheck
and root production build (Next 16.3.8, **23/23** generated pages, plus shared
and Nest compilation). After the review fix, focused client ESLint, root
typecheck and root production build passed again. Actual summary excerpts:

```text
npm run test --workspace=@acres/server -- --runInBand
Test Suites: 122 passed, 122 total
Tests:       1898 passed, 1898 total
Snapshots:   1 passed, 1 total

npm run test:e2e --workspace=@acres/server -- --runInBand --testTimeout=30000
Test Suites: 8 passed, 8 total
Tests:       159 passed, 159 total

PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100 npm run test:e2e --workspace=@acres/client -- tests/sse-stream.spec.ts
15 passed (1.2s)

node scripts/vercel/probe-platform.spec.js
ℹ tests 30
ℹ pass 30
ℹ fail 0
```

The server E2E matrix includes the existing real PostgreSQL/PostGIS and
infrastructure-failure tests; it does not prove Neon or real cloud scanners,
queues or storage. The full client run includes helper and browser cases;
local product-harness cases are not hosted integration evidence.

Initial checks exposed a stale expected transport error message and the old
SMTP/memory tuple assertion; both were updated for the new closed tuple. Three
ESLint unsafe-mock findings were fixed with typed mocks. The first broad unit
run also lacked the compiled parser child and had four `listen EPERM` failures;
a successful build and permitted local execution resolved those environment
failures. The restricted build reported `Could not parse output from
TypeScript's --showConfig.` before successful permitted reruns. Initial DB
checks found the local database still starting. Once ready, the integrated
data journey exceeded Jest's default **5000 ms** under concurrent checking;
the complete suite passed with an explicit **30000 ms** budget, unchanged
assertions, and serial execution. This is not a claim that the default-budget
invocation passed. The offline SDK dependency reclassification hit `ENOTCACHED`;
a permitted metadata fetch completed the exact-version development-only move.

Mandatory read-only review found no Critical/Important findings in this bounded
prerequisite change. Its one Minor finding was valid: polling waits observed
only subscription cancellation, delaying notification after budget expiry.
A new test first failed with a **50.266608 ms** notification delay (limit
**30 ms**), then passed after waits observed the combined polling signal.
The reviewer verified the narrow fix and reported no remaining findings.
These timing values describe that regression assertion/run, not a product SLO.

`npm run vercel:probe -- --help` passed without credentials. Calling `blob`
without the explicit isolated target exited **1** with the sanitized message:
`Platform probe failed or lacks required isolated-target configuration. No gate
approved; inspect the restricted provider console and verify cleanup.` No
remote call was authorized by this missing-configuration test. The new local
link/workspace lock check and extracted processing-body comparison passed;
`git diff --check` returned no output. Public contract, schema, RLS and
permission behavior remain unchanged by these prerequisites.

The full sequential Node 24 `npm run ops:check` exited **0**. Actual excerpts:

```text
10 vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 6 high)
Production dependency security audit passed (0 critical vulnerabilities)
Total production components: 702
Excluded dev/test packages:   872
License Compliance: PASSED (100% compliant with approved permissive licenses)
SAST Gate: PASSED (Zero unreviewed blockers and zero expired suppressions)
```

The audit passes the repository's configured critical-severity threshold; it is
not a zero-advisory claim. No force upgrade or unrelated advisory remediation
was performed. The operations test suites exercise local fixtures and the
reference tooling; they approve no Vercel launch category. The final launch
runner/dossier test stage reported **182 passed, 0 failed**, and the probe suite
then reported **30 passed, 0 failed**. New-file/scoped formatting and final diff
checks passed.

After the timeout fix, one concurrent full browser run had **91 passed,
1 failed, 9 skipped**: the pre-existing audit-history organization switch
expected one row but observed twenty. The changed stream tests passed. All six
audit-history tests passed unchanged in an isolated single-worker rerun; no
organization-selection code or assertion was changed. The failure cause has
not been established, so the isolated pass is not a claim of a fixed browser
race. Final single-worker whole-suite results are recorded below.

Final post-fix Node 24 whole-client verification:

```text
npm run test:e2e --workspace=@acres/client -- --workers=1
9 skipped
92 passed (1.9m)
```

The nine skipped cases are the existing opt-in audit-fault tests. Single-worker
execution matches the configured CI worker count. No test assertion or timeout
was weakened for this browser rerun. These are local browser/helper results,
including 375/800/1280 responsive cases, not hosted provider acceptance.
